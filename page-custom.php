 Template Name: Custom

 * This is your custom page template. You can create as many of these as you need.
 * Simply name is "page-whatever.php" and in add the "Template Name" title at the

 *
 * When you create your page, you can just select the template and viola, you have
 * a custom page template to call your very own. Your mother would be so proud.

             * Also, breaking content up into multiple pages is a horrible experience,
